                <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
                <p>The Coco Coffee House was established in 2016 by the Associated Students of Moringa School. Originally located in Kilimani Galana road, it was founded with the concept of creating a small eatery that would provide high quality coffee and offer an environment where students could relax between classes.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, we envisioned Coco Coffee House as more than just a place to get coffee. We offer the very best coffees and teas available. We strive to create a comfortable, inviting atmosphere and to be an integral part of the community. Many friendships, including several marriages, have developed at Coco Coffee House. Several books and many theses have been written at our tables. We take pride in being a good neighbor and local gathering place. We are dedicated to maintaining this feeling.</p>
                <p>We have been fortunate to be the recipient of many awards and accolades. We continue to pursue our goals in an effort to achieve excellence in all we do. We intend to survive the onslaught of chains and to endure long into the future. We will continue our commitment to our neighborhood and community.</p>
